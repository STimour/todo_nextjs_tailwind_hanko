# Todo List Project

Welcome to my Todo List project! This project aims to create a simple yet functional todo list application using modern web development technologies.

## Technologies Used

In this project, I've utilized the following technologies:

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps in building custom designs quickly. Tailwind CSS provides a set of pre-defined utility classes that enable rapid styling without the need to write custom CSS.

- **Hanko**: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. Hanko facilitates the creation of dynamic and responsive web applications by providing tools and components for front-end development.

## Project Overview

The Todo List project is designed to demonstrate the power and simplicity of Tailwind CSS in combination with Hanko for building user-friendly web applications. The todo list application allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, providing a seamless experience for managing daily activities.

## How to Use

To run the Todo List project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:

3. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager. I did it, with npm:
